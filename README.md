## Introduction

Brief introduction to your container runtime and its purpose.

## What are Linux Containers?

Linux containers, often referred to as LXC or Docker containers, are a lightweight and portable solution for packaging, distributing, and running applications. They provide a consistent environment for applications to run across different computing environments.

### How are Linux Containers Utilized?

Explain how Linux containers work, including concepts like namespaces, control groups (cgroups), and container images. Describe how containers isolate applications from the underlying system and provide a consistent runtime environment.

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install the Rust container runtime. Include any necessary steps or dependencies.

## Dependencies

List any dependencies required to build and run the container runtime.

## Usage

Explain how to use the container runtime, including any available commands or options.

### Example Commands

Provide examples of common commands for creating, running, and managing containers.

```bash
# Example command 1
rust-container run my-container /bin/bash

# Example command 2
rust-container list
